# BomberBoy
## A Tiny BomberMan Clone

Bomberboy is (obviously) a tiny BomberMan clone. I simply created it for fun and practice, specifically for more experience in responsive design, javascript and mobile devices. 

Therefore you will not find any animations (or sound). Moving entities are simply displayed by moving images.

This project will not be continued since I intend to create a much more sophisticated version including sound, animations and a level editor.

### Build
Simply run...
```
npm run freshSetup
```
...in the console and ...
```
npm start
```
...to start the server or...
```
npm run dev
```
...for nodemon.
